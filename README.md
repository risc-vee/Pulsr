## Pulsr

Pulsr is an in-process publish-subscribe broadcaster based on [.NET Channels](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/channels), designed to simplify message broadcasting by facilitating communication between components - such as in-process services within your web application - without the need for external services like message brokers (e.g., Redis, RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, or Azure Service Bus), although it is not intended as a replacement when those are necessary.
